# VRC-BakeryLightSwitch
A simple editor script to turn on and off Realtime lights in your scene. I made this script to make editing bakery lights easier for the VRChat worlds I use. You do not need any other packages for this script to work, but if you are not using bakery I cannot think of any applications why you'd want this  script. You also have the ability to exclude Realtime lights you do not want to turn off like the Depth Light for VRStage lighting as one example.

To use, import the package then drag and drop the prefab into your scene. Click the prefab in the scene then either activate or deactivate Realtime lights. You can also add lights to exclude from the script.

**BAKERY IS NEEDED TO USE THIS SCRIPT! YOU CAN PURCHASE IT AT THE UNITY STORE! https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/bakery-gpu-lightmapper-122218 **

This script was made to turn realtime lights on/off when using bakery.

To use simply place the prefab into the scene. Press enable realtime lights or disable realtime lights. You can add lights to exclude from being disabled.
